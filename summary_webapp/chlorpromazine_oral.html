<h2>Positive</h2>
<p>Many patients report significant relief from conditions like severe nausea, vomiting, and intractable hiccups. One user described how Chlorpromazine "worked great" for a bad stomach virus, while another noted it successfully stopped hiccups after several days of discomfort. Additionally, patients with psychiatric disorders mentioned positive effects, such as improved sleep and reduced anxiety, with one stating they felt "like a person again" and experienced far fewer intrusive thoughts.</p>
<h2>Negative</h2>
<p>Common side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, and difficulty waking up, with some patients experiencing troubling side effects like "Reckless Leg Syndrome," speech problems, and bedwetting. A notably distressing review highlighted that the medication almost killed one patient's father, causing severe muscle shutdown in a dialysis patient. Others mentioned feeling scared of the drug's effects, such as hallucinations and a total loss of personality.</p>
<h2>Noteworthy</h2>
<p>One patient expressed extreme concern, stating, "I now wet the bed and get highs from this drug. I see people and hear voices. I'm very scared, please help!" Conversely, another remarked, "I just started taking this today, I am a little scared of the side effects," indicating a general apprehension toward the drug's potential impacts.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Chlorpromazine has been effective for many in treating nausea, vomiting, and hiccups, with positive feedback particularly from psychiatric patients. However, concerns regarding severe side effects and personal safety are prevalent, necessitating careful monitoring by healthcare professionals.</p>
