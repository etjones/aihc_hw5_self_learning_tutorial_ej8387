<h2>Positive</h2>
<p>Many patients reported successful experiences with Versed, highlighting its effectiveness in alleviating anxiety before procedures. Users noted a sense of calm and relaxation, with one patient stating, "Versed made me feel like I was floating on a cloud - relaxed, no fear." Others appreciated the amnesic properties of the drug, which helped them avoid distressing memories of their medical procedures. A parent shared their child had a smoother hospital experience due to Versed, calling it "fantastic medication for pre-surgery."</p>
<h2>Negative</h2>
<p>Conversely, several reviews recounted severe negative experiences, particularly in children. Recurring themes included extreme agitation and violent behavior post-administration. One parent mentioned, "My son was violent... just uncontrollable," and another said, "It was a very scary experience... I will NEVER let anyone administer this drug to anyone in my family again." Additionally, some adults described troubling amnesia and memory issues, with one stating, "I woke gasping for air... with full body shudders that lasted for hours."</p>
<h2>Noteworthy</h2>
<p>A user expressed a sense of violation, comparing their experience to "mental 'rape'" due to the lack of information and consent regarding the amnesiac effects of Versed. Additionally, an older patient reported a chaotic episode requiring restraint post-administration, prompting a healthcare professional to warn against its use in elderly patients.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, while many patients find Versed beneficial for reducing anxiety and enhancing compliance during medical procedures, significant concerns exist regarding its side effects, particularly violent reactions in children and troubling memory loss in adults. Caution and thorough communication with healthcare providers are advised when considering its use.</p>
