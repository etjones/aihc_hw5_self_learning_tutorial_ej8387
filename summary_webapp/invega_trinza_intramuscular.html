<h2>Positive</h2>
<p>Many patients express satisfaction with Invega Trinza, particularly in terms of symptom control and stability. One user shared, "Overall I'm really happy with the medication," noting a significant lack of relapses. Another mentioned their son had stable mental health for three years, comparing the treatment favorably to previous hospitalizations. Additionally, a husbandâ€™s experience indicated that it works well for him. </p>
<h2>Negative</h2>
<p>Negative experiences were highlighted by multiple users, especially concerning severe side effects. One patient reported "memory loss, decline in cognitive skills, brain shrinking," leading to concerns about long-term effects. Another review detailed extreme side effects experienced by a 69-year-old woman, including "muscle tremors, involuntary muscle movement" and severe challenges with basic tasks. This user was profoundly upset, noting that these side effects could potentially be permanent.</p>
<h2>Noteworthy</h2>
<p>A son reported that his experience with Trinza was disappointing compared to Sustenna after it seemed less effective just a month and a half post-injection. He mentioned having to supplement with oral medications, which reflected a notable decline in managing symptoms effectively.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, Invega Trinza has been beneficial for numerous patients regarding control of psychotic symptoms and preventing relapses. However, significant adverse effects, especially cognitive decline and severe physical symptoms, have prompted some patients to stop using the medication or reconsider its efficacy.</p>
