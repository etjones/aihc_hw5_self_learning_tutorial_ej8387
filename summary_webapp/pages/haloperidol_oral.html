<h2>Positive</h2>
<p>Many patients have reported significant improvements in their symptoms with Haloperidol, particularly regarding psychosis and mood stabilization. One user described it as a "miracle drug" that stopped hallucinations and delusions, stating, "Life went almost back to normal in my house because of this medicine and my daughter is her sweet self again." Others have similarly praised its effectiveness in controlling severe mania, aggression, and Tourette's syndrome. A long-term user noted it almost completely eliminated their tics and allowed them to function well in daily life.</p>
<h2>Negative</h2>
<p>Numerous patients experienced severe side effects, such as akathisia, drooling, and restlessness. One review described an experience of "tremors, acute anxiety, and elevated blood pressure," leading the user to prefer other medications. Another individual reported anaphylactic shock, highlighting significant safety concerns. Some patients mentioned that it made them feel like "a zombie," while others noted cognitive impairments and discomfort.</p>
<h2>Noteworthy</h2>
<ul>
<li>A caregiver relayed the harrowing experience of a patient who became unresponsive and exhibited severe side effects, concluding that the medication should not be administered to the elderly or those unable to communicate.</li>
<li>One user shared that their mother lost the ability to swallow after being on Haloperidol for Alzheimerâ€™s-related agitation, noting, "Never administer Haldol to anyone with advanced dementia."</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Haloperidol presents a complex profile with notable benefits for some patients, especially those with serious mental health conditions. However, the reports of severe side effects and adverse experiences, especially in vulnerable populations, highlight the necessity for careful monitoring and consideration before prescribing.</p>
