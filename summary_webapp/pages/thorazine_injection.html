<h2>Positive</h2>
<p>Many patients reported that Thorazine Injection provided quick relief from severe symptoms, particularly nausea and hiccups. One reviewer mentioned, "I had almost instant relief and fell into a deep sleep within 1-2 minutes," highlighting its effectiveness in acute situations. Another noted that it successfully helped manage manic psychosis, saying it made him feel “like playing nice again” after treatment. For one cancer patient, the oral form of Thorazine effectively stopped hiccups caused by chemotherapy, which was seen as a significant benefit.</p>
<h2>Negative</h2>
<p>Conversely, several patients had severe negative experiences. One described feeling trapped in their own body, stating, "I couldn't sit, stand still, or lay in bed," leading to a recommendation against the medication. Another reported alarming reactions in a younger patient: “His oxygen dropped to 22 almost lost pulse.” Common side effects included dizziness, low blood pressure, and prolonged grogginess; as one user mentioned, “My legs went numb to where I couldn't move.”</p>
<h2>Noteworthy</h2>
<p>A striking outlier experience detailed how an individual felt "like nothing happened" and jokingly compared the effect to a "Trump serum," highlighting a dramatic dissociation from reality, indicative of the profound effects this drug can have on different individuals.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Thorazine Injection appears to be a double-edged sword; while it may offer rapid relief from severe symptoms for some, it can also lead to debilitating experiences and significant adverse reactions for others, especially in susceptible populations. Caution is advised when considering its use.</p>
