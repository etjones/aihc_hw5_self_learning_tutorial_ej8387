<h2>Positive</h2>
<p>Many patients report significant improvements in symptoms such as anxiety, mood stability, and hallucinations after starting Olanzapine. Some describe it as life-saving, enabling them to manage conditions like bipolar disorder, psychosis, and Tourette’s syndrome effectively. One reviewer stated, "Olanzapine saved my life, literally... I couldn’t even speak but now I can speak full sentences without having to tic at all." Others appreciated its quick onset of action, often noting relief from symptoms within days.</p>
<h2>Negative</h2>
<p>Common negative experiences include substantial weight gain, fatigue, and withdrawal symptoms. Multiple reviews mention rapid weight gain (up to 80 pounds), leading to diabetes in some cases. A user warned, “The weight gain is killing people mine has doubled." Other side effects cited include severe lethargy, emotional numbness, and changes in cognitive function, with comments like “I felt like a zombie with no feelings or emotions.”</p>
<h2>Noteworthy</h2>
<p>Some outlier experiences stand out, such as a young patient who gained 80 pounds, became meaner, and ended up with type 2 diabetes after only a few months of treatment. Another reviewer described grotesque visual side effects linked to the medication, saying it led to "imagine things on my skin" that caused significant distress.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While Olanzapine has provided relief for many patients struggling with severe mental health issues, the potential for serious side effects, particularly weight gain and dependence, is significant. The mixed feedback reflects the complexity of individual responses to this medication, highlighting the need for careful monitoring and management by healthcare providers.</p>
