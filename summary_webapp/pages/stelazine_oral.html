<h2>Positive</h2>
<p>Many patients express gratitude for Stelazine, citing its effectiveness in managing psychiatric conditions. One long-term user reports, "I have taken this drug for 31 years... I hope it is never discontinued," indicating stability in their bipolar disorder. Another shares, "It really works though," despite some side effects, reflecting a sentiment that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. A third patient notes that Stelazine "has restored me back to my way of thinking," highlighting its positive impact on their schizoaffective disorder.</p>
<h2>Negative</h2>
<p>Conversely, a significant number of users report adverse reactions. Common complaints include sedation, fatigue, dizziness, and specific side effects like hand tremors and loss of libido. One user dramatically criticized the drug, labeling it the "pill from hell," and described experiences of confusion and a life-threatening inability to breathe: "I could hardly breathe except through a deliberate act of will." This usage led to a severe deterioration of their mental state, illustrating the potential for serious negative effects.</p>
<h2>Noteworthy</h2>
<p>An outlier experience includes a review from a user who linked their past use of Stelazine to lasting complications: "My neurologist said this contributed to my drug-related Parkinson's." This points to severe long-term consequences that have affected their quality of life.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, while Stelazine has positively impacted many patients by stabilizing their mental health, others have encountered debilitating side effects and serious repercussions from its use. The variance in experiences highlights the need for careful monitoring and reevaluation of treatment efficacy and safety.</p>
