<h2>Positive</h2>
<p>Many patients found Vistaril helpful in managing anxiety and improving sleep. Some users reported significant relief, stating, "It helps me stay calm and helps my allergies," and "the medication works extremely well for my anxiety." Users appreciated that it is non-habit forming and can be effective for anxiety attacks when taken as needed, with one stating, "This is a life saver for me. I take 25mg at night and it helps me sleep all night."</p>
<h2>Negative</h2>
<p>However, numerous reviews noted unfavorable side effects and a lack of effectiveness. Common complaints included extreme drowsiness, a "zombie-like" state, and heightened anxiety. A particular user mentioned, "I wake up very groggy and lazy," reflecting a recurring theme. Others experienced more serious reactions, such as hallucinations and panic attacks: “It made me feel like I was going to piss myself really, really, really bad!” </p>
<h2>Noteworthy</h2>
<p>One alarming experience involved a patient who suffered severe side effects leading to hospitalization, stating, “It made me feel like I had a glass of wine,” but it didn’t address their anxiety. Another user noted debilitating side effects that “almost killed me,” highlighting the potential dangers when combined with other medications.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, while some patients have found Vistaril effective for anxiety and as a sleep aid, the drug's side effects and variable effectiveness have led many to recommend caution. Patient experiences vary widely, suggesting that it may not be suitable for everyone.</p>
