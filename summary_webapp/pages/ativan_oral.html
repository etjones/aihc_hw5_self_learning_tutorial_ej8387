<h2>Positive</h2>
<p>Many patients report that Ativan is highly effective for managing anxiety and panic attacks, often bringing relief within a short time after administration. Users appreciate its quick action, with some stating it allows them to function normally in social situations when severe anxiety arises. Comments include, "It has really changed my life!" and "I was able to leave my house without thoughts of having an attack." Patients find they can sleep better and feel more relaxed overall, benefiting from its calming effects.</p>
<h2>Negative</h2>
<p>Despite its effectiveness, Ativan has a significant number of negative reviews highlighting issues with addiction and withdrawal. Many users express concerns about dependency, stating that withdrawal symptoms can be severe and debilitating, often worse than their original anxiety. Users reported memory loss, cognitive impairment, feelings of lethargy, and irritability. One user shared, "I will die before I take this pill anymore," emphasizing the extreme backlash from abrupt discontinuation. </p>
<h2>Noteworthy</h2>
<p>Some extreme experiences include reports of hallucinations, severe cognitive issues, and psychological distress leading to suicidal thoughts. For instance, one reviewer mentioned becoming delusional, thinking the ER staff were "cannibals," and another user experienced total memory loss after taking the drug. Family members of patients have outlined drastic behavioral changes, warning that Ativan can exacerbate conditions in older adults, such as confusion and aggression.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, while Ativan offers significant benefits for many individuals dealing with anxiety and panic disorders, its highly addictive nature and potential for severe withdrawal symptoms cannot be overlooked. Caution is advised, and individuals should discuss the risks and management strategies with their healthcare providers, considering alternatives if addiction concerns arise.</p>
