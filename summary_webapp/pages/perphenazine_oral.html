Another user shared, "It has helped me become more stable with my bipolar disorder since I have been taking it."</p>
<h2>Negative</h2>
<p>Side effects mentioned include drowsiness, dizziness, and irritability. A few patients reported troubling experiences such as hallucinations, severe stomach issues, and permanent impotence.

<h2>Noteworthy</h2>
