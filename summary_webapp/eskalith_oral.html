<h2>Positive</h2>
<p>Many patients report that Eskalith (lithium) has been highly effective in stabilizing their moods and reducing severe mood swings, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. For example, one user noted, "Lithium has saved my life. Without it I would not be here." Another mentioned, "I have been able to function very well on lithium after a manic episode... to this point I have not had any negative side effects!" Users appreciate its efficacy in managing bipolar disorder, with several noting improvements after long periods of struggle with other medications.</p>
<h2>Negative</h2>
<p>Common side effects include excessive thirst, frequent urination, weight gain, and gastrointestinal issues. Some patients experienced severe adverse effects, including kidney failure and hypothyroidism. One user shared a harrowing experience with toxicity leading to confusion and severe health concerns, saying, "I honestly thought I was dying." Others reported feeling emotionally numb or lethargic, with one stating, "I feel lethargic at times and do not enjoy life as much."</p>
<h2>Noteworthy</h2>
<p>A few outlier experiences include severe adverse reactions leading to kidney failure and lifelong complications, prompting strong disapproval of lithium: "Although kidney failure is a rare side effect... it does occur." Also, a patient experienced hallucinations and profound anxiety, leading to an emphatic refusal to take the drug again.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, while many find Eskalith to be life-changing in managing their bipolar symptoms, some report significant risks and troubling side effects. A careful consideration of its benefits against potential severe outcomes is essential for those contemplating this medication.</p>
