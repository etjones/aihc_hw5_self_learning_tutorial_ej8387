<h2>Positive</h2>
<p>Many patients appreciate Hydroxyzine's effectiveness for managing anxiety and itchiness. Users frequently report that it successfully alleviates severe itching from conditions like hives, eczema, and allergic reactions, often within minutes. For example, one patient noted, "Within 30 minutes... all of my itching is completely gone." Others found it helpful for anxiety relief, stating it helps them stay calm during stressful situations. A user said, "I feel relaxed and calm since taking it!" Many also praise its ability to aid sleep without causing excessive grogginess the next day.</p>
<h2>Negative</h2>
<p>The most common side effect reported is significant drowsiness, which can impair daily activities. Patients often describe feeling like "a zombie" or "unable to function," with one saying they "couldn't hardly function" on the medication. Some also experience troubling side effects such as hallucinations, vivid dreams, increased anxiety, or heightened heart rates. One reviewer mentioned feeling "more anxious" and "uncomfortable" while on Hydroxyzine.</p>
<h2>Noteworthy</h2>
<p>Several patients cite extreme adverse reactions, including a significant increase in depression and suicidal thoughts, particularly in those with pre-existing mental health conditions. One user reported feeling "extremely tired all the time" and another claimed it led to severe panic attacks when it had previously been prescribed to alleviate them. Another reviewer experienced unexpected weight gain and nervousness.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hydroxyzine is viewed positively for its fast action in relieving itching and anxiety for some users, but it is accompanied by side effects that can be severe or debilitating for others.
