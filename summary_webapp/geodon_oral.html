<h2>Positive</h2>
<p>Many patients report that Geodon has had a significant positive impact on their mental health, particularly for managing symptoms of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Patients have described experiences of improved mood stability, increased energy, and a return to feeling "normal." For instance, one patient stated, "Geodon is a miracle drug for me... it has changed the way I plan my meals... my aggression is gone." Others noted weight loss as a benefit, appreciating that Geodon does not carry the same weight-gain risks associated with other antipsychotic medications.</p>
<h2>Negative</h2>
<p>Conversely, a significant number of users report severe side effects, including drowsiness, agitation, and a feeling of being like a "zombie." A particularly concerning case involved a patient who had a dystonic reaction leading to an emergency room visit. Another reported, "This medicine is horrible...it made me get very shaky." Some even described withdrawal symptoms when attempting to stop, indicating that it can have a severe impact on mental and physical health.</p>
<h2>Noteworthy</h2>
<ul>
<li>One patient expressed that after taking Geodon, "I lost all of the weight I gained on other antipsychotics," highlighting the drug's potential for weight neutrality.</li>
<li>Another extreme case described being in the hospital due to severe side effects, which included panic attacks and a feeling of losing control: "This medication... [gave] me a dystonic allergic reaction."</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While many patients found Geodon to be life-changing and effective in treating severe mental health conditions, the prevalence of severe side effects and withdrawal symptoms raises concerns. This medication may not be suitable for everyone, suggesting the importance of close monitoring and individualized treatment plans. Patients should maintain open communication with their healthcare providers to navigate its effects and any potential risks.</p>
