<h2>Positive</h2>
<p>Many patients report positive experiences with Risperidone, citing significant improvements in managing their conditions such as bipolar disorder, PTSD, and psychosis. For instance, one user states, “This is the best medicine I have been on since 10 years of diagnosis... I wish I had this from the beginning. 10 stars!” Others report feeling more stable, calmer, and able to handle their emotions better. Some noted that it had a life-changing impact, helping to curb thoughts of self-harm and anxiety.</p>
<h2>Negative</h2>
<p>However, a substantial number of patients experience concerning side effects, primarily weight gain, fatigue, and emotional flatness. Common complaints include reports of gaining significant weight (some claiming 30-100 lbs) and feelings of lethargy or being "zombified." A user remarked, “I gained 50 lbs from this medicine... I am still taking something else for anxiety btw. Everything else is fine BUT this medication." Others also report issues such as dizziness, akathisia, and severe anxiety exacerbation.</p>
<h2>Noteworthy</h2>
<p>One outlier shared a tragic perspective: "This medication not only did not work. It gave me 'Akathisia' which is why I attempted suicide." In contrast, others had life-affirming experiences, noting that it was a "lifesaver" for managing severe mental illness.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Opinions on Risperidone are mixed. While some patients find it to be a critical part of their treatment that greatly improves their quality of life, many express frustration and distress over the weight gain and other side effects, indicating a need for careful consideration and monitoring while on this medication.</p>
