<h2>Positive</h2>
<p>Many patients report that <strong>Paxil CR</strong> has dramatically improved their lives, citing significant reductions in anxiety, panic attacks, and depressive symptoms. Common positive sentiments include:

- "It's the best medication for my anxiety and panic disorder."
- "After starting Paxil, I felt normal again."

- Many report <strong>sexual side effects</strong>, including diminished libido and difficulties with orgasm.
- Patients also express concern about severe <strong>withdrawal symptoms</strong>, including mood swings, dizziness, and electric shock sensations upon discontinuation.

<h2>Noteworthy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some reviews include extreme reactions: one patient reported they experienced <strong>severe suicidal thoughts</strong> after starting Paxil, while another described a <strong>neurological reaction</strong> leading to hospitalization.</li>
<li>A recurring theme is the contrast in experiences. While some found relief, others reported exacerbated symptoms or troubling side effects, such as increased anxiety or mood changes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
