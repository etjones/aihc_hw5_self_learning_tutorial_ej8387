<h2>Positive</h2>
<p>Patients generally appreciate Midazolam for its potent calming effects, especially in stressful situations like surgeries. One user noted that it made them feel "giddy, floaty, and very giggly," while another reported it as an "absolute Godsend" for pre-surgical anxiety. Many find it effective for managing extreme anxiety and panic attacks in clinical settings, with one user mentioning it helped prepare them for an IV drip. </p>
<h2>Negative</h2>
<p>Conversely, some patients experienced serious adverse effects. One review detailed a dramatic onset of anxiety and panic attacks after receiving the drug, leading to tachycardia and low blood pressure. Another warned about the risks associated with long-term use, indicating that the effects can be severe and lasting. </p>
<h2>Noteworthy</h2>
<ul>
<li>A user described a peculiar side effect, stating they had "the strong urge to catch gypsies" after their first dosage, suggesting that while effects can be positive, they can also be unpredictable or unusual.</li>
<li>A contrasting experience where a patient found the medication "very mild" at a higher dosage, questioning its potency compared to other anxiety medications.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, while many patients find Midazolam helpful for acute anxiety and surgical preparation, there are significant risks associated with its use that should be considered, particularly regarding potential long-term effects and unexpected reactions.</p>
