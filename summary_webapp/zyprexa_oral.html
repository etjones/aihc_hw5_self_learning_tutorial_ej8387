<h2>Positive</h2>
<p>Many patients report that Zyprexa (Olanzapine) has significantly improved their mental health, especially in managing symptoms of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Users express feelings of stability, calmness, and relief from anxiety, with one stating, "This drug saved my life," and another claiming it "restored reality back to my life." Individuals have mentioned that it effectively reduces hallucinations and helps regulate mood swings. Several users also noted positive impacts on sleeping patterns.</p>
<h2>Negative</h2>
<p>A common complaint among patients is significant weight gain, often accompanied by increased appetite. Many users experienced rapid weight increases, with one reporting a 100-pound weight gain, which led to distress and health concerns, including diabetes and high cholesterol. Side effects such as extreme drowsiness, cognitive impairment, and emotional numbness are frequently mentioned, leading to frustrations like, "It made me feel like a zombie." Others noted withdrawal symptoms that include severe anxiety and depression.</p>
<h2>Noteworthy</h2>
<p>Some outlier experiences highlight severe adverse effects, such as amnesia ("I took one pill and completely blacked out") and neurologic symptoms described as Parkinsonism with lasting tremors. A notable account also reports a patient attributing multiple severe long-term health issues, including diabetes, directly to the use of Zyprexa. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Zyprexa appears to be effective for stabilizing mood and managing anxiety for a considerable number of patients, but the significant potential for weight gain and other side effects casts a shadow over its benefits. Many users report a love-hate relationship with the medication, balancing its efficacy against troubling physical health impacts. Proper monitoring and lifestyle management are often emphasized to mitigate these issues.</p>
