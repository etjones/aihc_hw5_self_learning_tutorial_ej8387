<h2>Positive</h2>
<p>Many patients report life-changing benefits from Rexulti, often emphasizing significant improvements in mood and decreases in depressive symptoms. Numerous reviews highlight increased motivation, clearer thinking, and improved cognitive function. For example, one patient stated, "This med helped with my anxiety noticeably but the restlessness was unbearable along with increased appetite... waking up several times a night to eat. Had to stop." Others appreciated its quick action, with some experiencing relief from severe depression within days. One user shared, "Rexulti has literally SAVED MY LIFE!!! It took my out of a YEAR straight of suicidal depression/severe anxiety in less than a week."</p>
<h2>Negative</h2>
<p>Despite the positives, there is a notable prevalence of negative experiences, particularly concerning side effects. Many patients reported significant weight gain, lethargy, and increased appetite, which severely impacted their lives. For instance, one user said, "I gained 50 lbs... My mental healthâ€™s never been better but at what cost?" Complications like agitation, confusion, insomnia, and in some severe cases, panic attacks were also reported. A patient detailed, "This medication almost ruined me had I continued to use it. I dot not recommend it."</p>
<h2>Noteworthy</h2>
<p>There are exceptional testimonials of outlier experiences, such as severe side effects prompting long hospitalization due to withdrawal symptoms. One user noted, "Completely turned my life around in short order," juxtaposed against another who recounted, "I had to stop because of the panic attacks." Additionally, one individual described life-altering relief from extreme suicidal ideation as a major turning point.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Rexulti appears to have a dual nature. Many users report profound improvements in mood and mental clarity, effectively transforming their quality of life. However, side effects, particularly weight gain and agitation, are common and can lead to a significant negative impact on physical health. Overall, while some find it a miracle solution, others experience severe adverse reactions, highlighting the need for careful consideration and monitoring during use.</p>
