<h2>Positive</h2>
<p>Patients expressed significant relief from symptoms associated with conditions like bipolar disorder. One user highlighted, "Life saver! helps more than anything else ever has!!!" Many found Lurasidone convenient, noting that it did not leave them feeling "drugged" and improved their daily functioning and mood. Another reported, "I do not feel 'drugged'... I am usually active and feel generally brighter."</p>
<h2>Negative</h2>
<p>However, several users reported severe side effects. One individual experienced akathisia, stating that despite feeling mentally fantastic, the physical pain became unbearable, leading to discontinuation: "the extreme pain and frustration of the side effects drove me mad." Others faced issues such as developing Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) and withdrawal symptoms, with one review stating, "I have a slow recovery to come back from the damage it has done."</p>
<h2>Noteworthy</h2>
<p>Particularly striking was a review from a user who quickly became enraged and required hospitalization: "I ended up on a mental ward because of this medication... I would never prescribe this medication to anyone ever!!"</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Lurasidone has demonstrated life-changing benefits for some patients, particularly in managing mood disorders. However, the side effects can be severe and detrimental, causing significant distress for others. Users should be aware of both potential benefits and risks when considering this medication.</p>
