<h2>Positive</h2>
<p>Many patients report that Thoradol injections provide significant relief from acute pain, particularly for conditions like back spasms, migraines, and post-surgical discomfort. Users frequently highlight the rapid onset of relief and the effectiveness in managing their pain, stating, "It worked wonders for my back pain" and "I felt instant relief and was able to move around again."</p>
<h2>Negative</h2>
<p>Conversely, several individuals have expressed strong negative feelings related to side effects. Common complaints include headaches, nausea, and stomach issues. One patient noted, "I developed a debilitating headache that lasted for days," indicating a severe reaction that overshadowed any pain relief benefits. </p>
<h2>Noteworthy</h2>
<p>A unique experience shared by a patient raised concerns about a possible link between Thoradol injections and the onset of shingles. They described significant post-injection complications, including continuous nerve contractions and subsequent shingles diagnosis, leading to questions about the drug's safety.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, while many patients praise Thoradol for its effective pain relief, there are substantial concerns regarding side effects, particularly among a subset of users. The drug can be a double-edged sword, providing immediate pain alleviation while potentially triggering adverse reactions in some individuals.</p>
